# Step 1 => Create a new Django app to handle user authentication and registration.

# Step 2 => In the models.py file, define the different user types as separate classes that inherit from the built-in Django User model.

# Step 3 => In the views.py file, create views for handling login, registration, and OTP verification. These views should handle the logic for generating and validating OTPs, and for creating and updating user instances.

# Step 4 => In the urls.py file, map the views to specific URLs for handling login, registration, and OTP verification.

# Step 5 => Create the necessary templates for displaying the login, registration, and OTP verification forms.

# Step 6 => Create the necessary forms for handling user input and validation.

# Step 7 => Create the necessary forms for handling OTP generation and validation.

# Step 8 => In the settings.py file, configure any necessary settings for sending OTPs (e.g. via email or SMS).

# Step 9 => Test the system thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all user types.
